# Exercise One : Installation and Setup #

## Summary ##

In this exercise you will install Node.js, the Arduino IDE and optionally the Atom text editor.

## Requirements ##

* A Mac, Linux or Windows machine.
* Internet access.

## Steps ##

#### Step 1 : Install Node.js ####

[Download the latest version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and install it on your machine.  Alternatively [use a package manager](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager).

If you are feeling adventurous you could instead download io.js, which is a fork of Node.js.  At the time of writing I haven't tested io.js with Johnny-Five, so I cannot guarantee that this will work.

To validate you Node.js install try the entering `node --version` at your command line. 

The Node.js installation includes _npm_, which is nodes [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager).  You should run `npm --version` at your command line to validate this as well.

#### Step 2 : Install the Arduino IDE ####

The IDE is available for Mac, Windows and Linux platforms.  You will use this to install the
Firmata API on to your Arduino UNO board.

[Visit this site to Download](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software) the Arduino IDE.

#### Step 3 : (Optionally) Install the Atom Text Editor ####

The Atom Text Editor is a free and hackable text editor that works well for editing Javascript and JSON (amongst other things).  It is available for Mac, Windows and Linux.

If you'd like to try it out, you can download it from the [Atom Website](https://atom.io).

If you have another editor or IDE that you prefer then you can skip this step.
